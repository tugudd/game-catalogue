# Game Catalogue
A Haskell program for keeping records of physical video game copies. I don't know why the university required us to do such a program on Haskell but here it is. The program allows viewing the catalogue, and creating, updating, or removing records. A simple program yet the choice of programming language made it pretty challenging to develop.
